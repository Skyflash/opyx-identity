# OPYX Identity Guidelines

## Introduction

The world of cryptocurrencies is characterized by a multitude of well-known projects with high Market Cap such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. and by thousands of coins and tokens (over 8000) that are mostly unknown to investors

## Opportunity

Our idea is to give the investor the opportunity to be part of a community of people who have been in the crypto world for a long time where they can find and decide, through voting, on which assets to invest in and what kind of strategies to use. At the same time, we would like to support emerging start-ups and green and eco-sustainable projects by giving them visibility and the opportunity to be chosen for any form of financing. The projects will be filtered initially through an in-depth study, those that will pass the first phase will be proposed in our social channels and, once the community itself analyzes the results of the study, a vote will be taken: in this way we will have a completely decentralized governance that decides where to direct the investment

## Main Goal

We believe that the world must be protected and our main goal is to finance especially eco-sustainable or revolutionary projects that can improve the quality of our life and the life of the earth itself.
